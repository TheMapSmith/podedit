<current_state>
Just completed Phase 3 (Transcript Navigation) execution and verification. All plans executed successfully, phase goal verified, documentation committed. Ready to begin Phase 4 (Cut Point Management) planning.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

## Phase 3 Execution - COMPLETE

- **Research**: Phase 3 research completed (03-RESEARCH.md created)
- **Planning**: 1 plan created (03-01-PLAN.md)
- **Execution**: Plan 03-01 executed successfully
  - Task 1: TranscriptController navigation methods - DONE (commit 08ece11)
  - Task 2: PlayerController onTimeUpdate callback - DONE (commit e8730ce)
  - Task 3: UI wiring and CSS - DONE (commit f68d1d0)
- **Documentation**: SUMMARY created (03-01-SUMMARY.md, commit e95495f)
- **Verification**: Phase goal verified - 4/4 must-haves passed (03-VERIFICATION.md)
- **Metadata**: ROADMAP, STATE, REQUIREMENTS updated (commit aaefd43)

## What Got Built

Bidirectional transcript-audio navigation:
- Click any word → audio seeks to that timestamp
- Play audio → current word highlights yellow, transcript auto-scrolls
- Manual scroll → auto-scroll pauses 1.5s then resumes
- All features working with native browser APIs (no dependencies)

## Next: Phase 4 - Cut Point Management

**Not started yet.** Next actions:

1. Run `/gsd:discuss-phase 4` to gather context and clarify approach, OR
2. Run `/gsd:plan-phase 4` to skip directly to planning

**Phase 4 Goal:** User can mark regions to remove and manage those marks with visual feedback

**Requirements:** CUT-01 through CUT-05 (5 requirements)

**Success Criteria:**
1. Mark start point at any position
2. Mark end point to complete region, see visual highlight
3. See all cut regions with timestamps
4. Edit region timestamps directly
5. Delete cut regions

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

## Phase 3 Technical Decisions

1. **Event delegation for clicks** - Single container listener instead of per-word listeners. Scales efficiently to thousands of words without memory leaks.

2. **1500ms scroll timeout** - Balances user control vs auto-scroll convenience. User can scroll freely, auto-scroll resumes after brief pause.

3. **scrollIntoView with block: 'center'** - Centers active word for better visibility vs 'start' or 'nearest' options.

4. **Linear word search (O(n))** - Simpler than binary search, sufficient performance for podcast transcripts. Can optimize later if needed.

5. **Native browser APIs only** - scrollIntoView, requestAnimationFrame, event delegation. Zero dependencies, optimal performance.

## Project Velocity

Consistent 2min/plan across all 5 completed plans (Phases 1-3). Total execution time: ~10 minutes.

</decisions_made>

<blockers>

None. All phases executing cleanly with consistent velocity.

## Project State

**PodEdit** - Podcast transcript editor for marking cut regions

**Progress:** 3 of 5 phases complete (60%)
- ✅ Phase 1: Audio Playback Foundation
- ✅ Phase 2: Transcription Integration
- ✅ Phase 3: Transcript Navigation
- ⏳ Phase 4: Cut Point Management (next)
- ⏳ Phase 5: Export & Finalization

**Architecture Established:**
- Service layer: AudioService, TranscriptionService, CacheService
- Controller pattern: PlayerController, TranscriptController
- Memory-efficient: URL.createObjectURL streaming, IndexedDB caching
- Performance: requestAnimationFrame 60fps updates, event delegation

**Phase 4 Dependencies:**
- Needs Phase 3 navigation to locate cut regions ✅
- Will build on transcript word spans with timestamp data ✅
- Will integrate with existing controller pattern ✅

**Codebase Health:**
- All commits atomic (per-task)
- All phases verified (must_haves checked)
- Zero technical debt or blockers
- Clean git history

<next_action>

**Immediate next step when resuming:**

```bash
/clear
/gsd:discuss-phase 4
```

OR skip directly to planning:

```bash
/clear
/gsd:plan-phase 4
```

**What will happen:**
1. Research how to implement cut region marking (visual overlays, state management, editing UX)
2. Create PLAN.md files for Phase 4 execution
3. Verify plans meet phase goal
4. Execute Phase 4 plans

**Expected complexity:** Moderate - needs state management for cut regions, visual overlays in transcript, timestamp editing UI. Likely 1-2 plans.
