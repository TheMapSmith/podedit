## Tech Debt Analysis

### Phase 2: Transcription Integration

**Missing formal verification document**
- **Impact:** Cannot verify claims against codebase systematically
- **Risk:** LOW - SUMMARY documents and integration checks confirm implementation
- **Effort:** 15-30 minutes to run gsd-verifier agent
- **Recommendation:** Run verification or accept as-is for v1.0

**API key in localStorage**
- **Impact:** Key visible in browser storage, no encryption
- **Risk:** LOW - v1.0 is local-only tool, no deployment
- **Effort:** Would require backend/secrets management (out of v1.0 scope)
- **Recommendation:** Acceptable for v1.0, document limitation

### Phase 4: Cut Point Management

**Missing formal verification document**
- **Impact:** Cannot verify claims against codebase systematically
- **Risk:** LOW - SUMMARY documents and integration checks confirm implementation
- **Effort:** 15-30 minutes to run gsd-verifier agent
- **Recommendation:** Run verification or accept as-is for v1.0

**No overlap validation when creating cuts**
- **Impact:** User can create overlapping cut regions
- **Risk:** LOW - May confuse downstream scripts, but not a blocker
- **Effort:** Add `overlaps()` check in `markEnd()` method
- **Recommendation:** Defer to v2.0 unless user testing reveals issues

**No minimum duration validation**
- **Impact:** User can create very short cuts (e.g., 0.1 seconds)
- **Risk:** LOW - Technically valid, may not be useful
- **Effort:** Add minimum threshold check (e.g., 1 second)
- **Recommendation:** Defer to v2.0 unless user testing reveals issues

### Phase 5: Export & Finalization

**UAT document created but tests not executed**
- **Impact:** No manual user testing performed
- **Risk:** MEDIUM - Functional gaps may exist
- **Effort:** 10-15 minutes to execute 6 UAT test cases
- **Recommendation:** Execute UAT before completing milestone

**Only placeholder VERIFICATION.md**
- **Impact:** No formal verification of export functionality
- **Risk:** LOW - Code inspection confirms implementation
- **Effort:** 10-15 minutes to run verification
- **Recommendation:** Run verification or accept SUMMARY as sufficient

---

## Recommendations

### Option A: Complete Milestone (Accept Tech Debt)

**Pros:**
- All functional requirements met
- Zero critical blockers
- All integration points wired
- Ready for user testing

**Cons:**
- 3 phases lack formal verification
- UAT tests not executed
- Minor feature gaps (overlap validation, etc.)

**Next step:** `/gsd:complete-milestone v1.0`

### Option B: Plan Cleanup Phase

**Create cleanup phase to address:**
1. Run gsd-verifier on Phases 2, 4, 5
2. Execute UAT tests from 05-UAT.md
3. Add overlap validation to CutController
4. Add minimum duration validation

**Pros:**
- Higher verification coverage
- UAT validated
- Minor features addressed

**Cons:**
- Delays milestone completion
- May be over-engineering for v1.0

**Next step:** `/gsd:plan-milestone-gaps`

---

## Summary

**Milestone v1.0 is functionally complete.** All requirements satisfied, all phases complete, all integration points wired, all E2E flows functional. The accumulated tech debt is **non-critical** and consists primarily of missing verification documents and minor feature gaps that were explicitly noted during implementation.

**Recommendation:** Execute UAT tests (10-15 minutes), then complete milestone. Defer verification document gaps and feature enhancements to v2.0 backlog.

| 3 | 03-VERIFICATION.md | ✅ PASSED | 4/4 truths |
| 4 | (none) | ⚠️ MISSING | N/A |
