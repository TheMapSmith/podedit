<objective>
Add getting started instructions to empty state with privacy-focused messaging and automatic collapse after first file upload.

Purpose: Eliminate "what do I do?" confusion for first-time users. Static instructions provide faster onboarding than tutorial modals (users skip modals, instructions are always visible when needed). Emphasize privacy value prop (browser-only processing) to build trust.

Output: Getting started section visible on page load, hidden after first file upload, describing 3-step workflow with privacy emphasis.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Add getting started section with 3-step workflow and privacy messaging</name>
  <files>index.html</files>
  <action>
    Add getting started section to HTML immediately after h1, before file upload:
    - Section ID: "getting-started-section"
    - CSS class: "getting-started-panel"
    - Heading: "Getting Started"
    - Three-step workflow with numbered list:
      1. Upload Audio: "Choose an MP3, WAV, or M4A podcast file (up to 100 MB)"
      2. Generate Transcript: "Click 'Generate Transcript' to create a timestamped transcript using AI (requires API key)"
      3. Mark & Export: "Click words to navigate, mark cut regions, then export edited audio or JSON file"
    - Privacy callout (bold or highlighted box):
      "Privacy first: All audio processing happens in your browser. Your files never leave your device."
    - Include icon or visual separator for each step (optional: use emoji or CSS ::before numbers)

    Add CSS styles for getting-started-panel:
    - Background: var(--bg-secondary) (card background)
    - Border: 1px solid var(--border-color)
    - Border-radius: 8px
    - Padding: 20px
    - Margin-bottom: 20px
    - Privacy callout: background var(--accent-primary) with opacity 0.1, padding 12px, border-radius 4px
    - Use CSS Custom Properties for dark theme compatibility
    - Match existing card styling (transcription-section, cut-section conventions)

    Add localStorage hide logic:
    - On page load: check localStorage.getItem('onboarding_completed')
    - If true: add 'hidden' class to getting-started-section
    - In file input change handler (after file loaded successfully):
      - localStorage.setItem('onboarding_completed', 'true')
      - Add 'hidden' class to getting-started-section
    - Use existing .hidden { display: none; } class

    Content tone: Concise, action-oriented, trust-building. Avoid marketing fluff. Users want to know what to do, not read paragraphs.

    Why static HTML (not modal/tooltip): Empty state instructions are contextual - they appear when needed (no file loaded) and disappear when not needed (file loaded). Modals interrupt workflow and create dismissal fatigue.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Open index.html in browser:
    - Verify getting started section visible on page load (before file upload)
    - Verify 3 steps clearly numbered and described
    - Verify privacy callout visible and emphasized
    - Upload a file
    - Verify getting started section hides after file loads
    - Refresh page
    - Verify getting started section stays hidden (localStorage persists)
    - Open DevTools > Application > Local Storage: verify onboarding_completed = true
    - Clear localStorage, refresh: verify getting started section reappears
  </verify>
  <done>
    - Getting started section displays on empty state (no file loaded)
    - Three-step workflow described (upload, transcribe, mark/export)
    - Privacy value prop emphasized (browser-only processing)
    - Section hides after first file upload
    - localStorage persists onboarding_completed state
    - Dark theme styling applied via CSS Custom Properties
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

Manual browser testing:
1. Fresh browser session (clear localStorage): verify getting started visible
2. Read instructions: verify 3 steps clear, privacy messaging prominent
3. Upload test file: verify section hides immediately
4. Refresh page: verify section stays hidden
5. Clear localStorage, refresh: verify section reappears
6. Check dark theme styling: verify colors match card sections (transcription, cuts)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Getting started section visible on page load before file upload
- Section contains 3 numbered steps describing workflow
- Privacy callout visible emphasizing browser-only processing
- Section hides after first file upload event
- localStorage correctly stores onboarding_completed flag
- Section styling matches existing card components using CSS Custom Properties
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/10-dark-theme-&-onboarding-ui/10-02-SUMMARY.md`
